This tool is currently in beta v0.1, as I'm still finalizing the UTAU English non-human CVVC voicebank generator. To use it, first prepare your vowel recordings using ARPA phonemes in the vowels folder. Then, modify the input and output paths in the script and run it. Afterwards, manually copy the consonant clusters from the ALSO COPY THESE TO YOUR OUTPUT LIBRARY folder into your final voicebank directory. Finally, you can generate the complete CVVC voicebank by using Moresampler's English oto function. I have also expanded upon the original recording list. An update will be released once this script is fully packaged. Thank you!
